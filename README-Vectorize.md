## Usinng Pgvector
When using pgvector, the extension is primarily designed to provide a specialized vector column type and efficient indexing for similarity search. However, if you have a table with a large number of vector columns—or you need to store multiple kinds of vector representations—the following considerations and strategies can help optimize both schema design and query performance:

1. Single vs. Multiple Vector Columns
	•	Single Vector Column per Table:
pgvector is most effective when used to store one main embedding (vector) per record. This allows you to build an efficient index (e.g., using the ivfflat index) for similarity queries on that column.
	•	Multiple Vector Columns:
If you need to store more than one vector per record (for example, a text embedding and an image embedding), you can define multiple vector columns:

CREATE TABLE documents (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    content text,
    text_embedding vector(768),
    image_embedding vector(768)
);

However, keep in mind that each vector column you plan to use for similarity search should have its own index. Indexing many vector columns can increase maintenance overhead and impact performance.

2. Schema Design Considerations
	•	Separate Tables:
If the vectors are used in different contexts (e.g., one for search and another for analysis), consider storing them in separate tables. This can simplify your queries and allow you to build indexes only on the columns you actually query frequently.
	•	Composite Structures:
In some cases, it might make sense to combine multiple related vectors into one composite vector (if they represent parts of a single feature) rather than having them as separate columns. This can simplify indexing and similarity search if the semantics allow it.

3. Indexing Strategy
	•	Index Only When Needed:
Create indexes only on the vector columns that will be used for similarity search. For example:

CREATE INDEX ON documents USING ivfflat (text_embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

If a vector column is only stored for reference or occasional use, you might avoid indexing it to keep insert/update operations faster.

	•	Tune Index Parameters:
Depending on the dimensionality and number of vectors, you may need to tune index parameters (like the number of lists in IVFFLAT) to get optimal performance.

4. Query and Application Considerations
	•	Querying Specific Vectors:
When querying, be explicit about which vector column you’re targeting for similarity search. For example:

SELECT id, content
FROM documents
ORDER BY text_embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.768]'::vector
LIMIT 10;


	•	Application Logic:
Consider whether all vector data needs to be in one table. In many cases, it might be more efficient to load only the necessary vector from a join on a dedicated table, particularly if the vector columns are rarely used simultaneously.

Summary
	•	Optimize by using a single vector column per context when possible.
	•	Separate concerns by using different tables if you have multiple unrelated vector types.
	•	Index only the columns that will be queried for similarity, and tune the indexes to match your data’s dimensionality and volume.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use pgvector in tables with many vector columns while managing performance and maintainability.


## Attribute-rich table
When using pgvector with a wide, attribute-rich table (like your vehicle master with over 300 fields), the idea isn’t to store every field as a separate vector column but to create a meaningful embedding that represents the record as a whole. Here are some strategies:

1. Feature Extraction and Embedding
	•	Preprocessing:
Instead of ingesting all raw fields directly into pgvector, combine and preprocess the data to extract features that are relevant for similarity search or downstream tasks. For example, you might concatenate key fields or use domain-specific transformations.
	•	Embedding Generation:
Use a machine learning model (such as a transformer or a dedicated tabular data model) to convert the preprocessed record into a fixed-size embedding (for example, a 768-dimensional vector). This vector should capture the important attributes of the vehicle.

2. Schema Design
	•	Original Data and Embedding:
In your vehicle master table, keep the original 300+ fields for detailed record-keeping, and add an extra column for the embedding. For example:

CREATE TABLE vehicle_master (
    vin VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    -- ... other 300+ vehicle attributes ...
    embedding vector(768)  -- Dimension matches your embedding model output
);

For your sales transaction table, you can join to the vehicle master on VIN and use the stored embedding for similarity searches or recommendations.

	•	Separate Table for Embeddings:
Alternatively, if you prefer not to mix raw attributes with computed embeddings, maintain a separate table that maps the vehicle (or sales transaction) to its vector:

CREATE TABLE vehicle_embeddings (
    vin VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding vector(768)
);



3. Ingestion Process
	•	ETL Pipeline:
Build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process where you:
	•	Extract: Read the vehicle records from your source.
	•	Transform: Preprocess and generate the embedding using your chosen ML model.
	•	Load: Insert or update the record in your PostgreSQL table with the computed vector.
	•	Batch or Streaming:
Depending on your data volume and update frequency, you can run this as a batch process (e.g., nightly) or in near-real time using triggers or a messaging system.

4. Indexing and Querying
	•	Index the Vector Column:
Create an index on the embedding column to speed up similarity queries:

CREATE INDEX ON vehicle_master USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

Adjust index parameters based on your data and query performance requirements.

	•	Query Example:
When searching for similar vehicles, you would use a query that leverages the vector index:

SELECT vin, /* other attributes */
FROM vehicle_master
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.56]'::vector
LIMIT 10;

The <-> operator computes the distance between vectors, returning the most similar records.

5. Handling the Sales Transaction Table
	•	Join on VIN:
In your sales transaction table, store the VIN (or a reference to the vehicle master record) along with sales-specific details. When you need to perform similarity searches or recommendations, join the sales data with the vehicle master (or embedding table) on VIN.
	•	Example Query:
To retrieve sales transactions along with similar vehicles:

SELECT st.*, vm.embedding
FROM sales_transaction st
JOIN vehicle_master vm ON st.vin = vm.vin
WHERE vm.embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.56]'::vector < some_threshold;



Summary
	•	Extract a representative embedding from the wide set of attributes rather than storing all fields as vectors.
	•	Store the embedding as a dedicated column (or in a separate table) alongside the original data.
	•	Use an ETL pipeline to preprocess, generate, and load these embeddings into PostgreSQL.
	•	Index and query the embedding column to enable efficient similarity search.

By following these steps, you can leverage pgvector for similarity search while still preserving the rich, detailed data in your vehicle master and sales transaction tables.

## 768-dimensional vector
A 768-dimensional vector is simply a list or array of 768 numbers (usually floating-point values) that together represent some data in a high-dimensional space. Here’s what that means in practice:
	•	Representation:
Instead of working directly with raw data (like text or vehicle attributes), many machine learning models transform the data into a numerical format. This transformation is called an embedding. A 768-dimensional vector is one such embedding where each of the 768 numbers captures a specific feature or aspect of the input data.
	•	Common Use Case:
Many popular models (for example, BERT or other transformer-based models) output embeddings of this size. The idea is that similar inputs will have similar embeddings, meaning the vectors will be “close” to each other in this high-dimensional space. This makes it useful for tasks like similarity search, clustering, or recommendation systems.
	•	Why 768 Dimensions?
The choice of 768 dimensions is often a design decision by the model creators. It’s considered a good balance between capturing enough detail about the input while keeping computational requirements manageable. In other words, 768 dimensions tend to capture enough nuance to differentiate between inputs without being overly burdensome to compute or store.

In the context of your database and pgvector, using a 768-dimensional vector means that each record (like a vehicle record) could be transformed into a numerical representation of 768 features. This representation can then be indexed and compared for similarity, helping you quickly find related records based on their underlying features.


## Example : Vehicle master and sales

When using a separate table for embeddings, you decouple the raw vehicle attributes from the computed embedding. This approach provides flexibility for updating embeddings independently, keeping your vehicle master table lean, and isolating the compute-heavy parts. Here’s a guide with schema examples and an ETL function:

1. Schema Setup

Vehicle Master Table

This table stores all raw vehicle data (e.g., over 300 fields) without embedding data.

CREATE TABLE vehicle_master (
  vin VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  -- Other vehicle attributes:
  make TEXT,
  model TEXT,
  year INT,
  color TEXT
  -- ... and many more fields ...
);

Vehicle Embeddings Table

This separate table holds the computed embeddings. It uses the same primary key (VIN) to link to the vehicle master.

CREATE TABLE vehicle_embeddings (
  vin VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding vector(768)
);

2. Embedding Generation Function

Using the pgai extension, you can write a function that extracts the relevant features from the vehicle master and generates an embedding. Adjust the function name and parameters as needed based on your pgai API (here, we assume a function like ai_generate_embedding exists).

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_vehicle_embedding(p_vin VARCHAR)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  rec RECORD;
  input_text TEXT;
  result_embedding vector(768);
BEGIN
  -- Fetch the vehicle record from the master table.
  SELECT * INTO rec FROM vehicle_master WHERE vin = p_vin;
  
  IF rec IS NULL THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Vehicle with VIN % not found', p_vin;
    RETURN;
  END IF;
  
  -- Concatenate key attributes (customize as needed).
  input_text := rec.make || ' ' || rec.model || ' ' || rec.year::TEXT || ' ' || rec.color;
  
  -- Generate the embedding using the pgai extension.
  result_embedding := ai_generate_embedding(input_text, 'llama2-7b');  -- Example model
  
  -- Upsert the embedding into the vehicle_embeddings table.
  INSERT INTO vehicle_embeddings (vin, embedding)
  VALUES (p_vin, result_embedding)
  ON CONFLICT (vin) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

3. Populating and Maintaining the Embeddings

Initial Population

Run an update across your vehicle master table to generate embeddings for all records:

DO $$
DECLARE
  r RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN SELECT vin FROM vehicle_master LOOP
    PERFORM generate_vehicle_embedding(r.vin);
  END LOOP;
END;
$$;

Automating Updates

You can also set up a trigger on the vehicle_master table so that whenever a record is inserted or updated, the corresponding embedding is automatically generated or refreshed:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_update_embedding()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM generate_vehicle_embedding(NEW.vin);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_embedding_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON vehicle_master
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_update_embedding();

4. Querying Data with Embeddings

Similarity Search on Vehicles

Join the master table with the embeddings table to perform similarity searches. For example, to find vehicles similar to a given query vector:

SELECT vm.vin, vm.make, vm.model, vm.year,
       ve.embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.56]'::vector AS distance
FROM vehicle_master vm
JOIN vehicle_embeddings ve ON vm.vin = ve.vin
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 10;

Integrating Sales Data

If your sales transaction table references the vehicle by VIN, you can join all three tables to combine raw vehicle data, embeddings, and sales info:

SELECT st.transaction_id,
       vm.vin,
       vm.make,
       vm.model,
       st.dealer,
       st.customer,
       ve.embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.56]'::vector AS similarity
FROM sales_transaction st
JOIN vehicle_master vm ON st.vin = vm.vin
JOIN vehicle_embeddings ve ON vm.vin = ve.vin
WHERE ve.embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.56]'::vector < 0.5
ORDER BY similarity;

Summary
	•	Separate Storage:
Use a dedicated vehicle_embeddings table linked via VIN to decouple raw data from embeddings.
	•	ETL Function:
Create a function (generate_vehicle_embedding) that extracts key features, generates an embedding, and upserts into the embeddings table.
	•	Automation:
Consider triggers to automatically update embeddings when the vehicle master data changes.
	•	Query Integration:
Join the master and embeddings tables (and optionally sales data) to enable efficient similarity searches.

This approach keeps your primary vehicle data intact while leveraging pgai and pgvector for efficient similarity search and analysis.
